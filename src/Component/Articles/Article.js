                    <p className="article-description">When I started coding in December 2020, all I was made to believe was that what I needed to be a front-end engineer was the knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I thought this is what the tech space needs me to be good at to become a front-end developer. As someone who wanted to become a full stack, I accepted this wholeheartedly, but no, the industry is way more than that.</p>

                    <p className="article-description">When creating a program, there will be thousands of lines of code that cannot be stored in a single file. It is always a good idea to break it down into smaller, more maintainable, and reusable pieces of code. This is where functions come in. In this article, I will look at the following Python functions, arguments, and key word arguments.</p>

                    <p className="article-description">List comprehension allows you to create a list with a single line of code. List are collections of data separated by commas and covered by square brackets. A list comprehension is surrounded by square brackets as well, but instead of data, expressions are entered, followed by for-loops and if clauses.</p>

                    <p className="article-description">
                        Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. What this means is that every class in Java is supposed to be a blueprint for an object with the same name. Think of an object as an instance of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.</p>

                    <p className="article-description">In Python, the most flexible data structure is the list. Python's data structures include four types: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Depending on what you're building, you can use these Python data structures to solve specific tasks. This built-in data structure comes in handy when creating real-world applications.</p>
